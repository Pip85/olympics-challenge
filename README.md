## **process**
We pulled two csv files from Kaggle:<br>
summer-olympics.csv<br>
gdp.csv<br>

Data for gdp.csv was normalized for 2020 USD.<br>
Data from both files was cleaned using pandas and Jupyter Notebook.<br>


![Cleaning]()<br>

Several graphs were created for analysis of medals per country/sport, example below:<br>

![Medals]()<br>

Linear regression and performed and r2 calculated to prove correlation between countries winning the most medals and their GDP<br>

![Regression]()<br>

Hypothesis was proven - there is correlation between countries winning the most medals and their GDP.<br>
